# Twilite SDK
## The easiest way to develop applications that utilize the Ethereum blockchain.

</br>

## Description

TwiLite SDK is designed to greatly simplify your development process for the Ethereum blockchain. By automating the majority of tasks, it allows you to focus on making straightforward JavaScript-based method calls using the TwiLite SDK. With TwiLite, you can effortlessly send Ether, deploy and interact with smart contracts, and much more, all while enjoying significantly less complexity than other libraries or approaches.

For instance, with TwiLite SDK, you can deploy a smart contract using just a single method call that automatically handles smart contract compilation, gas estimation, and deployment. This simplicity ensures a smoother, more efficient development experience for your Ethereum projects.
